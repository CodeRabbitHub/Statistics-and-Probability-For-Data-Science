    "## The Central Limit Theorem\n",
    "\n",
    "The Central Limit Theorem (CLT) posits that the distribution of *sample means* drawn from a population will approximate a normal distribution, irrespective of the shape of the population distribution, provided the sample size is sufficiently large (typically n > 30). Even for populations that are already normally distributed, the theorem remains valid for smaller sample sizes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Estimating the Population Mean\n",
    "\n",
    "While the sample mean serves as an estimate for the population mean, it's essential to recognize that the standard deviation of the sampling distribution ($\\sigma_{\\overline{x}}$) differs from the population standard deviation ($\\sigma$).\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Standard Error\n",
    "\n",
    "The standard deviation of the sampling distribution ($\\sigma_{\\overline{x}}$) is termed the **standard error** and is linked to the population standard deviation by the formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\sigma_{\\overline{x}} = \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, $\\sigma$ represents the population standard deviation, and $n$ denotes the sample size. \n",
    "\n",
    "As the sample size increases, the standard error diminishes toward 0, and the sample mean ($\\overline{x}$) converges towards the population mean ($\\mu$).\n"

    "### Point Estimate\n",
    "\n",
    "A point estimate is a single statistic calculated from a sample used to estimate an unknown population parameter. For instance, the sample mean can serve as a point estimate for the population mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interval Estimate\n",
    "\n",
    "An interval estimate is a range of values believed to encompass the true population parameter. It represents the margin of error in estimating the population parameter.\n",

    "### Confidence Interval\n",
    "\n",
    "A confidence interval is a range of values within which the population mean is presumed to lie. It can be calculated as follows:\n",

    "#### When Population Standard Deviation is Known\n",
    "\n",
    "For a random sample of size $n$ with mean $\\overline{x}$, taken from a population with standard deviation $\\sigma$ and mean $\\mu$, the confidence interval for the population mean is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\overline{x} - \\frac{z\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}} \\leq \\mu \\leq \\overline{x} + \\frac{z\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}$$\n",

    "#### When Population Standard Deviation is Unknown\n",
    "\n",
    "In cases where the population standard deviation is unknown, the sample standard deviation ($s$) substitutes $\\sigma$ in calculating the confidence interval:\n",

    "$s$: Sample standard deviation (used as an estimate of the population standard deviation when it's unknown).  \n",
    "$z$: The critical value from the standard normal distribution corresponding to the desired confidence level. It is determined based on the chosen confidence level (e.g., 95% confidence level corresponds to a z-score of approximately 1.96). This value is used to calculate the margin of error.\n",
