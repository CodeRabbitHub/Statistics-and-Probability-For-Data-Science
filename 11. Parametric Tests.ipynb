    "# Parametric Tests:\n",
    "\n",
    "Parametric tests are statistical tests that are based on the assumption that the data being analyzed follows a normal distribution. These tests are used to make inferences about population parameters based on a sample of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## One-Sample Test:\n",
    "\n",
    "A one-sample test is used when there is only one population of interest, and a single sample is taken from it. The test determines if there is a significant difference between the values in the sample and the population parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Two-Sample Test:\n",
    "\n",
    "A two-sample test is used when samples are collected from two different populations. The test assesses whether the population parameters are significantly different based on the sample parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Critical Test Statistic:\n",
    "\n",
    "A critical test statistic is the limiting value of the sample test statistic used to determine whether to accept or reject the null hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Region of Rejection:\n",
    "\n",
    "The region of rejection is the range of values where the null hypothesis is rejected. The region of acceptance is the area where the null hypothesis holds.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Types of Tests\n",
    "The following four types of tests will be discussed:\n",
    "\n",
    "+ **Z-tests**: Used for large sample sizes (n >= 30) with known population standard deviation.\n",
    "+ **T-tests**: Used for small sample sizes (n < 30) with unknown population standard deviation.\n",
    "+ **F-tests**: Used for comparing values of more than two variables.\n",
    "+ **Chi-square**: Used for comparing categorical data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## One-Tail Test (Directional Test):\n",
    "\n",
    "A one-tail test is performed when testing for a change in the mean, with knowledge of the direction of the change.  \n",
    "\n",
    "There are two types of one-tail tests:  \n",
    "\n",
    "+ **Upper one-tail**: The region of rejection is on the right tail. This test is performed when testing if the mean score has increased.\n",
    "+ **Lower one-tail**: The region of rejection is on the left tail. This test is performed when testing if the mean score has decreased.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Two-Tail Test (Non-Directional Test):\n",
    "\n",
    "A two-tail test is performed when testing for a change in the mean, without knowledge of the direction of the change. The region of rejection is located on both tails of the distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The P-value:\n",
    "\n",
    "The p-value is used to determine whether to accept or reject the null hypothesis. It is calculated based on the sample data and is compared to a significance level, typically 0.05. \n",
    "+ If p < 0.05, it suggests that the sample data is unlikely to be random and not representative of the population. In this case, the null hypothesis is rejected. \n",
    "+ If p > 0.05, it indicates that there is a higher probability that the sample is not representative of the population, and the null hypothesis is not rejected.\n",
