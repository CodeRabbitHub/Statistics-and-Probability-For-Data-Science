    "## **What are variables ?**\n",
    "\n",
    "In statistical research, a variable is defined as an attribute of an object of study. Choosing which variables to measure is central to good experimental design. We use these variables to predict the outcomes of an experiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "If we want to predict price of a house, we need to to look at information like How many bedrooms doe the house have?  What Locality the house belongs to? How old is the house? Facilities near by? Does it have garage or a pool? These features from which we predict the price of house are called as Vaiables.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Data is generally divided into two categories:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Quantitative** data represents amounts  \n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Continous** - Distance, Time\n",
    "    - **Descrete** - Number of students in a class, Rolling of die\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Categorical** data represents groupings  \n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Nominal** - Names of people, colors\n",
    "    - **Ordinal** - Rating (High, Medium, Low), Grades(A, B, C, D, E, F)\n",
    "    - **Binary** - Heads/tails in a coin flip, Yes or No   \n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "## Independent and Dependent variables\n",
    "\n",
    "**Independent Variable**: Variables that we manipulate in order to affect the outcome of an experiment are known as Independent variables. The independent variable is the *cause*. Its value is independent of other variables in our study. Independent variables are also refered as Explanatory variables (they explain an event or outcome) or Predictor variables (they can be used to predict the value of a dependent variable)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dependent Variable**: Variables that represent the outcome of the experiment. The dependent variable is the effect. Its value depends on changes in the independent variable. Dependent Variables are also refered as Response variables (they respond to a change in another variable) or Outcome variables (they represent the outcome we want to measure)  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Levels of Measurement**\n",
    "\n",
    "Levels of measurement, also called scales of measurement, tell you how precisely variables are recorded. In scientific research, a variable is anything that can take on different values across your data set (e.g., height or test scores).\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 4 levels of measurement:\n",
    "\n",
    "+ **Nominal**: the data can only be categorized\n",
    "+ **Ordinal**: the data can be categorized and ranked\n",
    "+ **Interval**: the data can be categorized, ranked, and evenly spaced\n",
    "+ **Ratio**: the data can be categorized, ranked, evenly spaced, and has a natural zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on the level of measurement of the variable, what you can do to analyze your data may be limited. There is a hierarchy in the complexity and precision of the level of measurement, from low (nominal) to high (ratio).\n"
