    "+ **Random Experiment**: An experiment is considered random if the results or outcomes obtained from performing the experiment repeatedly under the same conditions or in the same manner differ each time. In other words, when the outcome is completely unpredictable.  \n",
    "Examples: Rolling a die, Tossing an unbiased coin.\n",

    "+ **Sample Space**: This is a comprehensive list of all the possible outcomes of an experiment.  \n",

    "Probability is a measure of the likelihood of an event to occur.  \n",

    "n(A) is number of outcomes of event A to happen.  \n",
    "n(S) is number of all possible outcomes.  \n",

    "\n",
    "The law of large numbers states that as the size of a sample grows larger, the average or mean of the sample values will approach the expected value.\n",
    "\n",
    "This can be demonstrated through the simplest example of flipping a coin. The probability of the coin landing heads is 1/2, so the expected outcome over an infinite number of flips is 1/2 or 0.5.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, if we only flip the coin 10 times, we might observe that it lands heads only 3 times, which is not close to the expected value of 0.5. This is because the sample size of 10 flips is too small to accurately reflect the expected value.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we continue to flip the coin more, the proportion of heads will approach 0.5. For example, after flipping the coin 20 times, we might find that it landed heads 9 times, and after 30 flips, we might find that it landed heads 22 times. As the sample size grows, the proportion of heads converges to the expected value of 0.5.\n",
