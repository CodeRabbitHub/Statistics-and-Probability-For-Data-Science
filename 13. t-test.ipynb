    "# T-Test\n",
    "\n",
    "In cases where the standard deviation of the population is not known and the sample size is small, the T-distribution is used. This distribution is also known as the \"Student's T distribution\".\n",
    "\n",
    "The following are the key features of the T-distribution:\n",
    "\n",
    "+ It has a shape that is similar to a normal distribution but is slightly flatter.\n",
    "+ The sample size is typically small, usually less than 30.\n",
    "+ The T-distribution takes into account the concept of degrees of freedom. These are the number of observations in a statistical test that can be calculated independently. For example, if we have three numbers $x$, $y$, and $z$ and know that the mean is 5, we can conclude that the sum of the numbers must be $5 \\times 3 = 15$. We have the freedom to choose any value for $x$ and $y$, but not $z$. $z$ must be chosen so that the numbers add up to 15 and the mean remains at 5. Despite having three numbers, we only have the freedom to choose two of them, meaning we have two degrees of freedom.\n",
    "+ As the sample size decreases, the degrees of freedom decrease, and the population parameter can be predicted with less certainty from the sample parameter. The degrees of freedom (df) in the T-distribution is equal to the number of samples minus 1, or $df = n - 1$.\n",

    "The formula for the critical test statistic in a one-sample t-test is given by the following equation: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$t = \\frac{\\overline{x} - \\mu}{\\frac{s}{\\sqrt{n}}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\overline{x}$ is the sample mean, $\\mu$ is the population mean, $s$ is the sample standard deviation, and $n$ is the sample size.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. The size of the sample is small ($< 30$).\n",
    "2. The population standard deviation is not known; we use the sample standard deviation ($s$) to calculate the standard error.\n",
