    "There may be situations where the standard deviation of the population is unknown, and the sample size is small. In all such cases, we use the T-distribution. This distribution is also called *Student’s T distribution*.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following are the chief characteristics of the T-distribution:\n",
    "+ The T-distribution is similar in shape to a normal distribution, except that it is slightly flatter.\n",
    "+ The sample size is small, generally less than 30.\n",
    "+ The T-distribution uses the concept of degrees of freedom. The degrees of freedom are the number of observations in a statistical test that can be estimated independently.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Example: Suppose we have three numbers x, y and z. If we know the mean is 5. we can say the sum of numbers should be 5*3 = 15. Now we have freedom to choose any number as x and y, but not z. z should be choosen in a way such that the numbers add upto 15 so the mean turns to be 5. So even though we have 3 numbers we have freedom to choose only 2. i.e. we have 2 degrees of freedom.    \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "+ As the sample size decreases, the degrees of freedom reduce, or in other words, the certainty with which the population parameter can be predicted from the sample parameter reduces.The degrees of freedom (df) in the T-distribution is the number of samples (n) -1, or in other words, df = n - 1  \n",
