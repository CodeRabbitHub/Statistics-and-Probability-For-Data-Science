# Statistics-and-Probability-For-Data-Science

In this repository, I will delve into the fundamental concepts of statistics and probability through the use of Python programming language. The following topics will be covered:

1. Permutations and Combinations
2. The basics of probability, including conditional probability and the law of large numbers
3. Bayes' theorem and its applications
4. Probability distributions, including binomial, uniform, geometric, Poisson, and normal distributions
5. Measures of central tendency and variability, as well as skewness and kurtosis
6. The central limit theorem, estimation, and confidence intervals
7. Sampling methods and errors
8. Hypothesis testing, significance levels, P values, and confidence intervals
9. Parametric tests, including z-tests (one-tailed and two-tailed) for means and proportions and t-tests (paired t-test)
10. Analysis of variance (ANOVA)
11. Nonparametric tests, such as chi-square tests
12. Effect size, correlation, power, and power analysis.
