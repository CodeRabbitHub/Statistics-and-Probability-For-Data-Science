    "**Bayes theorem** is a theorem used to calculate the conditional probability of an event, given some evidence related to the event. Bayes theorem establishes a mathematical relationship between the probability of an event and prior knowledge of conditions\n",
    "related to it. As evidence related to an event accumulates, the probability of this event can be determined more accurately.\n",

    "Consider a scenario where a person has tested positive for an illness. This illness is known to impact about 1.2% of the population at any given time. The diagnostic test is known to have an accuracy of 85%, for people who have the illness. The test accuracy is 97% for people who do not have the illness. What is the probability that this person suffers from this illness, given that they have tested positive for it?  \n",
