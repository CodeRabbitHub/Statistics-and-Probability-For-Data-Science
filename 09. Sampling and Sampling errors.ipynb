    "## Sampling\n",
    "\n",
    "Sampling serves as a fundamental technique for acquiring insights into a population by gathering data from a representative subset, rather than assessing every individual within the population. It presents a pragmatic approach when exhaustive data collection proves impractical. However, it is imperative that the sample mirrors the population's characteristics accurately.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Probability Sampling\n",
    "\n",
    "Probability sampling ensures that every member of the population possesses an equal chance of selection, thereby facilitating the creation of a sample that faithfully mirrors the population. Several commonly employed probability sampling techniques include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Simple random sampling**: Subjects are selected entirely at random, without bias or preference, ensuring each has an equal probability of inclusion.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Stratified random sampling**: The population undergoes division into non-overlapping groups, from which subjects are randomly chosen. This method ensures representation across all relevant categories or strata.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Systematic random sampling**: Subjects are chosen at regular intervals, offering simplicity in execution but potentially risking representativeness if the interval choice is inappropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Cluster sampling**: The population divides into non-overlapping clusters, from which a subset is randomly selected. This method offers convenience and cost-effectiveness.\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages of Probability Sampling\n",
    "- Mitigation of Sample Bias\n",
    "- Representation of Diverse Population Characteristics\n",
    "- Generation of Accurate Sample Representations\n",
    "\n",
    "### Non-Probability Sampling\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-probability sampling deviates from the principle of equal probability of selection, thus increasing the likelihood of acquiring a non-representative sample. Commonly utilized non-probability sampling techniques include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Convenience sampling**: Conveniently accessible subjects form the sample, often leading to ease of implementation but potential representativeness issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Judgmental or purposive sampling**: Selection is based on predefined criteria, aligning with the study's objectives, albeit potentially biasing the sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Quota sampling**: Quotas ensure the sample reflects significant population characteristics, albeit without the assurance of equal probability of selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Snowball sampling**: Initial subjects refer additional participants, commonly employed in populations with low visibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: Non-probability sampling typically yields less reliable and less generalizable results compared to probability sampling methodologies.\n"

    "## Types of Errors in Sampling\n",
    "\n",
    "When making inferences about a population based on a sample, it's possible to encounter various types of errors. These errors can be grouped into the following categories:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Sampling Error**: The difference between the sample estimate for the population and the actual population estimate\n",
    "- **Coverage Error**: Occurs when the population is not adequately represented and some groups are excluded\n",
    "- **Nonresponse Error**: Occurs when we fail to include nonresponsive subjects who meet the criteria of the study, but are excluded because they do not answer the survey questions.\n",
    "- **Measurement Error**: Occurs when the correct parameters are not measured due to flaws in the measurement method or tool used.\n"
